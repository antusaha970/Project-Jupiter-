                <h3>Why to code?</h3>
                <ul >
                    <li>Code is the foundation of nearly every aspect of our lives, from the apps we use on our phones to the systems that keep our world running smoothly.</li>
                    <li>As a programmer, you'll have the skills to create and build anything you can imagine. You'll also have the chance to solve complex problems and make a real impact on the world.</li>
                    <li> With the right skills, you'll be able to work in a wide variety of industries and roles, from software development to data analysis to machine learning.</li>
                    <li>Mastering a new skill is always rewarding, and the sense of pride and satisfaction you'll feel after successfully completing a project will be worth all the hard work.</li>
                    <li>Learning to code can seem intimidating, but it's important to remember that everyone starts somewhere. Encourage them to start small and take things one step at a time.</li>
